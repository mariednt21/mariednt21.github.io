				Once upon a time, magical creatures and humans lived together peacefully, until a new king thirsty for power decided that magical beings were a threat to the kingdom. The creatures were no longer allowed to roam the village.All the shops closed one by one. No more fantasy in village life, no more joy but only despair and loneliness. Without magic, the land was wasting away, the crops were no longer as good and the population  slowly  began  to  suffer  from  famine. Any  inhabitant  coming  into  contact  with  a magical creature could end up in prison for betrayal against the human race. One day, due to poverty and undernutrition, a virus started to spread in your village, but no human cure were efficient.... You know what is the only solution to save your family and the village : find  the  witch  of  the  lands  who  holds  all the  magic  remedies,  more  effective than all those  known  by  humans. This  means walk  through  the  enchanted  forest,  full  of  all  kinds  of creatures, plants and maybe royal guards...
